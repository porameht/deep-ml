# Python Deep Machine Learning

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental machine learning, linear algebra, and information retrieval algorithms from scratch. The focus is on understanding the mathematical foundations of these algorithms through clean, commented code examples.

## Overview

This project aims to implement a wide variety of algorithms including but not limited to:

- Linear algebra operations
- Machine learning fundamentals
- Information retrieval techniques
- Optimization algorithms
- Neural network components
- Natural language processing basics
- Clustering and classification methods

Each implementation is designed to be educational, with thorough documentation and examples that illustrate the underlying mathematical concepts.

## Current Implementations

The repository currently includes a few example implementations, with many more to be added:

- Matrix-vector operations
- Matrix transformations
- Information retrieval scoring (BM25)

## How to Use

Each file contains a self-contained implementation with example usage. To run any implementation:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

The naming convention for files follows a numbering system that loosely categorizes the algorithms.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy (for some implementations)
- Additional dependencies may be required for future algorithms

## Educational Purpose

These implementations are designed for educational purposes to help understand the inner workings of algorithms used in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. The code is thoroughly commented to explain each step of the algorithms.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add an algorithm implementation or improve existing ones, please feel free to submit a pull request.
