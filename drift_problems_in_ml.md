## Definition of Drift

Drift refers to changes in the statistical properties of data or the relationships between input and output data over time, causing ML models that once performed well to decline in performance.

ML models are built under the assumption that future data will be similar to the training data. However, in reality, data characteristics often change over time, leading to drift problems and decreased model performance.

## Types of Drift

### Data Drift (Feature Drift)

**What is it**: Data Drift or Feature Drift is a change in the distribution of input variables (features) that the model uses for prediction.

**Causes**:
- Changes in user behavior
- Changes in data collection channels
- External factors such as seasonality, special events, or disasters

**Effects**:
- The model receives input data that differs from the training data
- Decreased prediction accuracy

**Solutions**:
- Verify the feature generation process
- Retrain the model with new data

### Label Drift

**What is it**: Label Drift is a change in the distribution of target variables or data classes.

**Causes**:
- Changes in the definition of targets or classes
- Changes in the label collection process
- Changes in the proportion of different classes

**Effects**:
- The model predicts outcomes inconsistent with current reality
- The model becomes biased toward classes frequently found in training data

**Solutions**:
- Verify the label creation and collection process
- Retrain the model with data having new label distributions

### Prediction Drift

**What is it**: Prediction Drift is a change in the distribution of model predictions.

**Causes**:
- Changes in feature distributions
- Changes in the relationship between features and targets
- Errors in model updates

**Effects**:
- Predictions may be biased in a particular direction
- Impact on business processes that use prediction results

**Solutions**:
- Verify the model training process
- Evaluate business impacts from prediction changes

### Concept Drift

**What is it**: Concept Drift is a change in the relationship between input variables (features) and target variables.

**Causes**:
- Changes in user behavior
- Latent factors influencing relationships
- External events changing data relationships (like pandemics)

**Effects**:
- Even when features resemble training data, the relationship between features and targets has changed
- The model cannot predict accurately despite receiving data similar to training data

**Solutions**:
- Analyze additional feature engineering
- Consider alternative methods or models
- Retrain or fine-tune the model with new data

## Detecting Drift with Python

Several libraries help detect drift in ML models, such as Alibi Detect and Evidently. In the following examples, we'll use these libraries to detect various types of drift.

### Detecting Data Drift

We can use the KS test (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to detect changes in the distribution of numerical variables:

```python
import numpy as np
from alibi_detect.cd import KSDrift

# Create reference data
np.random.seed(0)
reference_data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)

# Create drift detector
drift_detector = KSDrift(reference_data, p_val=0.05)

# Normal data (no drift)
normal_data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 500)
print("Normal data:")
print(drift_detector.predict(normal_data))

# Data with drift (mean changed)
drift_data = np.random.normal(2, 1, 500)
print("\nData with drift:")
print(drift_detector.predict(drift_data))
```

For categorical variables, we can use the Chi-squared test:

```python
import numpy as np
from alibi_detect.cd import ChiSquareDrift

# Create reference data (categories: 'small', 'medium', 'large')
np.random.seed(0)
categories = np.array(['small', 'medium', 'large'])
reference_data = np.random.choice(categories, size=1000, p=[0.5, 0.3, 0.2])

# Create drift detector
drift_detector = ChiSquareDrift(reference_data, p_val=0.05)

# Normal data (no drift)
normal_data = np.random.choice(categories, size=500, p=[0.5, 0.3, 0.2])
print("Normal data:")
print(drift_detector.predict(normal_data))

# Data with drift (proportions changed)
drift_data = np.random.choice(categories, size=500, p=[0.2, 0.2, 0.6])
print("\nData with drift:")
print(drift_detector.predict(drift_data))
```

### Detecting Label Drift

Label drift can be detected using methods similar to Data Drift detection, but focusing on label distribution:

```python
import numpy as np
from alibi_detect.cd import ChiSquareDrift

# Create reference label data (binary: 0, 1)
np.random.seed(0)
reference_labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000, p=[0.7, 0.3])

# Create drift detector for labels
label_drift_detector = ChiSquareDrift(reference_labels, p_val=0.05)

# Normal label data (no drift)
normal_labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=500, p=[0.7, 0.3])
print("Normal labels:")
print(label_drift_detector.predict(normal_labels))

# Label data with drift (proportions changed)
drift_labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=500, p=[0.3, 0.7])
print("\nLabels with drift:")
print(label_drift_detector.predict(drift_labels))
```

### Detecting Prediction Drift

We can check for changes in the distribution of model predictions as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from alibi_detect.cd import KSDrift
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Create data and model
np.random.seed(0)
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=2000, n_features=10, random_state=0)
X_train, X_test = X[:1000], X[1000:]
y_train = y[:1000]

# Create and train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Generate predictions on test data (reference predictions)
reference_predictions = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Probability of class 1

# Create drift detector for predictions
prediction_drift_detector = KSDrift(reference_predictions, p_val=0.05)

# Create new data with similar characteristics
X_new_normal, _ = make_classification(n_samples=500, n_features=10, random_state=1)
normal_predictions = model.predict_proba(X_new_normal)[:, 1]
print("Normal predictions:")
print(prediction_drift_detector.predict(normal_predictions))

# Create new data with drift
X_new_drift, _ = make_classification(n_samples=500, n_features=10, weights=[0.1]*5 + [0.9]*5, random_state=2)
drift_predictions = model.predict_proba(X_new_drift)[:, 1]
print("\nPredictions with drift:")
print(prediction_drift_detector.predict(drift_predictions))
```

### Detecting Concept Drift

Concept Drift is difficult to detect directly because it involves the relationship between inputs and outputs. One method is to monitor model performance over time:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from evidently.metrics import ColumnDriftMetric
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.test_preset import DataDriftTestPreset
import pandas as pd

# Create data and model
def generate_data(n_samples, shift=0):
    X = np.random.normal(0, 1, (n_samples, 2))
    # concept: y = 1 when x1 + x2 > 0
    # with shift, concept changes to y = 1 when x1 + x2 > shift
    y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > shift).astype(int)
    return X, y

# Create training data and train model
X_train, y_train = generate_data(1000)
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create reference data and measure performance
X_ref, y_ref = generate_data(500)
y_pred_ref = model.predict(X_ref)
acc_ref = accuracy_score(y_ref, y_pred_ref)
print(f"Accuracy on reference data: {acc_ref:.4f}")

# Create new data with concept drift (concept changed)
X_drift, y_drift = generate_data(500, shift=1.0)  # shift value changes the concept
y_pred_drift = model.predict(X_drift)
acc_drift = accuracy_score(y_drift, y_pred_drift)
print(f"Accuracy on data with concept drift: {acc_drift:.4f}")

# Use Evidently Library to analyze drift
# Create DataFrame
ref_df = pd.DataFrame(X_ref, columns=['feature_1', 'feature_2'])
ref_df['target'] = y_ref
ref_df['prediction'] = y_pred_ref

drift_df = pd.DataFrame(X_drift, columns=['feature_1', 'feature_2'])
drift_df['target'] = y_drift
drift_df['prediction'] = y_pred_drift

# Create Report
report = Report(metrics=[
    ColumnDriftMetric(column_name='feature_1'),
    ColumnDriftMetric(column_name='feature_2'),
    ColumnDriftMetric(column_name='target'),
    ColumnDriftMetric(column_name='prediction')
])

report.run(reference_data=ref_df, current_data=drift_df)
report_result = report.as_dict()

# Display drift score for each column
for metric_name, metric_value in report_result['metrics'].items():
    if 'drift_score' in metric_value:
        print(f"{metric_name} drift score: {metric_value['drift_score']:.4f}")
```

## Solutions for Drift Problems

When drift is detected, we can implement several solutions:

1. **Data Updates**: Retrain the model with new data that reflects current distributions

```python
# Example: Retrain model with new data
X_new_combined = np.vstack([X_train, X_drift])
y_new_combined = np.concatenate([y_train, y_drift])
model.fit(X_new_combined, y_new_combined)

# Test new performance
X_test_new, y_test_new = generate_data(500, shift=1.0)
y_pred_new = model.predict(X_test_new)
acc_new = accuracy_score(y_test_new, y_pred_new)
print(f"Accuracy after retraining: {acc_new:.4f}")
```

2. **Improved Feature Engineering**: Add or improve features to help the model better handle changes

3. **Using Adaptive Models**: Use models that can adapt to data changes

```python
# Example: Adaptive model
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier

# Create adaptive model
online_model = SGDClassifier(loss='log', alpha=0.01, max_iter=1000, 
                             tol=1e-3, random_state=0, learning_rate='adaptive')

# Initial training with training data
online_model.partial_fit(X_train, y_train, classes=np.unique(y_train))

# Measure initial performance
y_pred_online = online_model.predict(X_drift)
acc_online_before = accuracy_score(y_drift, y_pred_online)
print(f"Accuracy of adaptive model (before adaptation): {acc_online_before:.4f}")

# Update model with some new data
batch_size = 100
for i in range(0, len(X_drift), batch_size):
    X_batch = X_drift[i:i+batch_size]
    y_batch = y_drift[i:i+batch_size]
    online_model.partial_fit(X_batch, y_batch)

# Measure performance after adaptation
y_pred_online_after = online_model.predict(X_drift)
acc_online_after = accuracy_score(y_drift, y_pred_online_after)
print(f"Accuracy of adaptive model (after adaptation): {acc_online_after:.4f}")
```

4. **Using Transfer Learning Techniques**: Apply knowledge from existing models to new environments

5. **Using Ensemble Learning**: Use multiple models together to reduce risk from drift

## Conclusion

Drift problems are a significant challenge in deploying machine learning models in real-world settings, as data and environments constantly change. Understanding the types of drift—Data Drift, Label Drift, Prediction Drift, and Concept Drift—helps us detect and address issues precisely.

Regular drift monitoring and model updates are crucial for maintaining ML system performance. Libraries like Alibi Detect and Evidently help us detect drift effectively, providing tools to manage these issues.

By recognizing drift problems and preparing appropriate responses, we can develop ML systems that are flexible and effective in the long term, ensuring our models continue to provide value to the business despite changing environments.
